## PORTFOLIO PROJECTS — Links to Additional Details in Project Titles

## Better Reads — A Platform for Readers to Track, Share, and Discover New Books

•	Used Agile & Scrum methodologies to iteratively deploy Natural Language Processing (NLP) models

•	Practiced CI/CD via blue/green RESTful Flask microservices on AWS EB to facilitate JSON post requests

•	Launched and managed a PostgreSQL instance on AWS RDS to store millions of GoogleBooks data

## Flight Prices — Airline Pricing Analysis and Interactive Pricing User-Interface

•	Built front-end user interface with Flask for user to interact w/ a predictive machine learning model

•	Tediously gathered 27M rows of data, wrangled/cleaned to 9M, uploaded data to Kaggle

•	As a data analyst, I generated statistical analyses, distribution charts, and business intelligence insights

## Brain Power — Using Machine Learning and an EEG Device to Control Technology

•	Built an application for the user to control light switches & thermostats with their brain

•	Collected data from an EEG device and used Scikit-Learn to train a predictive model

•	Deployed back-end Python get request API w/ Flask: communicate w/ EEG device, detect brain patterns

## Spotify Music — Recommends New Music Based on Your Favorite Songs

•	Connected with Spotify’s API to harvest data (and metadata) about the songs in their database

•	Built back-end Python API’s (get and post requests) to return predicted songs data to front-end

## Global Glaciers —Geographic Visualizations of the Locations of Earth’s Glaciers

•	Data exploration, story-telling with data, and unique data visualizations
